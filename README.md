[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-41BDF5.svg)](https://github.com/hacs/integration)

This is a custom component for Home Assistant to integrate with the Zehnder ComfoAirQ ventilation system. 

It's an upgrade over the existing `comfoconnect` integration and is meant for testing purposes. The goal is eventually to replace the existing `comfoconnect` 
integration in Home Assistant.

## Features

* Control ventilation speed
* Control ventilation mode (auto / manual)
* Show various sensors

This integration supports the following additional features over the existing integration:

* Configurable through the UI.
* Allows to modify the balance mode, bypass mode, temperature profile and ventilation mode.
* Changes to fan speed won't be reverted after 2 hours.
* Support to clear alarms.

## Installation
